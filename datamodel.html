                        <h3>The hypothesis states that "The tweets were made strategically at dates where election-related news/events were happening."</h3>
                        <b><p style="text-align:justify;"> <!-- Perform the appropriate statistical test based on the hypothesis. -->
                            In order to prove the hypothesis, the data scientists needed to determine whether the number of tweets 
                            have any relationship with the date when the tweets were made.
                        </p></b>
                        <b><p style="text-align:justify;"> <!--Identify and validate the assumptions of the chosen statistical model. -->
                            By identifying the variables in the dataset, the scientists chose the most appropriate statistical model
                            as guided by a Scribbr flowchart. The predictor variable is the <i>date</i> which is quantitative in nature and 
                            the target variable is the <i>number of tweets</i> which is also quantitative in nature.
                            The scientists utilized the <i>Linear Regression Model</i> in order to determine if the number of tweets have
                            any relationship with the date posted. 
                        </p></b>
                        <b><p style="text-align:justify;"> <!-- Clearly report the test statistics, p-values, and any effect size measures. -->
                            These are the returned results of the model: <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- RMSE = 3.89 <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- R2 = 0.29 <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P(x1): 0.0033617160347947355 <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There is a significant relationship between the predictor and response <br>
                        </p></b>
                        <b><p style="text-align:justify;"> <!-- Interpret the results and provide a conclusion based on the hypothesis test. -->
                            The RMSE tells us the average difference between the actual and predicted values. The R2 tells us
                            us how well the regression line approximates the actual data. These two aren't really significant
                            in this context since we aren't trying to predict the values but rather determine the relationship between variables. <br>
                            The p-value, whose value is significantly below the 0.05 threshold, is the most important component 
                            of the outcome. This indicates that there is a strong correlation between the quantity of tweets and 
                            the posting date.
